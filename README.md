# Codewars
My imperfect solutions to some of the challenges on codewars.com

Here I'll archive my solutions in Python to various levels of kata on codewars.com 

If anyone does come across this repository by chance, I would recommend to first give it a shot yourself. I have not created this repository with the intention of providing solutions for others as this defeats the point... It's merely to track my own progress.
